Upgrade vite from ^6.0.1 to ^6 across all packages. Vite 6.0.1 had a bug causing parser errors with CSS imports in TypeScript files, which is fixed in Vite 6.3.0+. Also fixed Svelte component issues (self-closing tags, ARIA attributes) and moved CSS import to main.ts to preserve runtime-generated classes.
